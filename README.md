inlinelistview
==============

##[DEMO](http://alspringer.github.io/)

A listview for jQuery Mobile where items can be opened inline.

To use:
Use data-role="inlinelistview" instead of data-role="listview"

For an item that you want to open inline. Add the property data-rel="inline" to the item, set the inner a-href to the id of the <li> that you want to be shown when the link is clicked.

For the list item to be shown:
Simple set the id equal to what you referenced from the link in the listview.
